                j4backlight
   
Simple logarithmic-scale backlight controller for my laptop.
Covers the full range of legal brightnesses. (In my case, from 1/852
to 852/852.)

Relies on the /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/ interface.

Motivation: xbacklight only works on a 1-100 scale, and has no
built-in logarithmic behavior.
